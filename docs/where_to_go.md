# Where to go from here?

What now?

If this material was a bit overwhelming for you, I'd suggest taking a step back
and reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book).
Or at least, the first 10 chapters.

If this was easy for you, you may want to look into:

- other data types (you may need to activate extra features in the `Cargo.toml` file
  e.g. `dtype-dates`)
- "vertical" operations (note: you'll almost certainly want to set `elementwise=False`)
- leveraging existing Rust crates.

This tutorial is work-in-progress, and more topics will make their way in.
