# Where to go from here?

What now?

If this material was a bit overwhelming for you, I'd suggest taking a step back
and reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book).
Or at least, the first 10 chapters.

Next, you may be interested in looking at existing plugins for inspiration.
There's a nice list of them in the official user guide: https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/plugins/your-first-polars-plugin/#community-plugins.

Finally, you should definitely join the Discord Server, where there's a channel
dedicated to plugins: https://discord.gg/4UfP5cfBE7.
