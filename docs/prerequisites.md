# 0. Prerequisites

First, you'll need a Python3.8+ virtual environment with:

- polars>=0.20.0
- maturin>=1.4.0 (but older versions _may_ work too)

Next, you'll need to have Rust installed, see [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for
how to do that.

That's it! However, you are highly encouraged to also install
[rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html) if you want to
improve your Rust-writing experience by exactly 120%.
