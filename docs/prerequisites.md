# 0. Prerequisites

First, you should probably make new directory for this project.
Either clone https://github.com/MarcoGorelli/polars-plugins-tutorial,
or make a new repository.

Next, you'll need a Python3.8+ virtual environment with:

- `polars>=0.20.0`
- `maturin>=1.4.0` (but older versions _may_ work too)

installed.

You'll also need to have Rust installed, see [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for
how to do that.

That's it! However, you are highly encouraged to also install
[rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html) if you want to
improve your Rust-writing experience by exactly 120%.
