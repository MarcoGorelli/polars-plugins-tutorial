Thank you to [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/) for having provided support to this project during their internships
programme, during which [Bruno Conde](https://github.com/condekind) made very significant contributions to chapters on Strings,
performance (`Vec<Option<T>>` vs. `Vec<T>`), nested data types (Array, List, Struct), the CI process, and the "can we run doom?" extra.
